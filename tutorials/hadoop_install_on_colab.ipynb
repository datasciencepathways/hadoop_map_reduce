    "In our previous tutorial we went through the steps of installing a single-node, pseudo-distributed Hadoop cluster on a Linux system. This tutorial will describe how to build and configure a single-node Hadoop system on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Google Colab is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud. \n",
    "As we will see, setting up Hadoop on Google Colab is much easier than setting it up on your system. However, the downside is that you will need to repeat the installation step each time you launch a Google Colab notebook. The reason for this is that Google Colab gives a new VM each time you open a notebook. Nontheless, Google Colab is a great sandbox for getting some practice with Hadoop and distributed processing, among many other things.  \n",
